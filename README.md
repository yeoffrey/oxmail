# OxMail

A simple email TUI written in Rust and implemented with [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/)

# The Ramblings of a Mad Man

I don't have much experience writing Rust, so I'm changing that by writting a basic email client for the terminal. Why? Because I really don't like the existing options and that's it. I don't want a calendar or a bunch of random features that "increase productivity". God dammit just let me send a freaking email and give me some feedback that it actually sent.

Anyways wish me luck <3
